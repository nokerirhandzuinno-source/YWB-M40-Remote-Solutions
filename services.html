    <h2>1. Origin Story: From Limpopo to Argentina</h2>

It began as a lifeline and is now evolving into a remote-first business that retains its spark while actively contributing across borders. From the dust of Limpopo to the streets of Argentina, this system carries the weight of lived experience and the fire of self-determination.</p>
